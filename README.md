# POI Service
The map related service that has two main functions:
1. Return points of interest for given coordinates (returned from in-memory Redis cache)
2. Finds the shortest route between to place on the world map (predefined sample map, integrates with JGraphT library)

# Run locally on Windows
1. Download the latest Redit release from https://github.com/tporadowski/redis/releases
2. Unzip and run redis-server.exe
3. Run the main method in PoiServiceApplication
   
# Points of interest function
The service assigns a zone for given coordinates and returns points of interest for that zone.
Sample call: http://localhost:8080/points-of-interest?longitude=3.0&latitude=49.00&poiType=MUSEUM

* latitude - latitude of a user
* latitude - longitude of a user
* [optional] poiType - point of interest type, supported values: TOURIST_ATTRACTION, MUSEUM, PARK, RESTAURANT

# Shortest route function
The service calculates the shortest route between two places. Places are part of the world map (predefined sample world map generated by ChatGPT).
It uses the strategy design pattern where the shortest path for each mean of transport is calculated in a separate *Strategy class, which can
be extended separately.
The shortest path is calculated based on:
* distances between all places between place A and place B
* mean of transport that determines which routes can be included in the path between place A and place B
  (eg. some routes are only accessible by cars and some only by foot)
  
The algorithm used does not use DijkstraShortestPath class provided by JGraphT as it doesn't support finding path for a given mean of transport.
  
Sample call: http://localhost:8080/route?startPlaceName=Budapest&endPlaceName=Madrid&meanOfTransport=CAR

* startPlaceName - place name where the path should begin 
* endPlaceName - place name where the path should end
* meanOfTransport - mean of transport that the shortest path should be found for, supported values: CAR, BIKE, FOOT
